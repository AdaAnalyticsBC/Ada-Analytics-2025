## Configuration

### Environment Variables
The frontend doesn't require specific environment variables for basic functionality, but you can configure:

```bash
# Optional: Set custom port
PORT=3000

# Optional: Set base URL for API calls
BASE_URL=https://your-api-domain.com
```

### Railway Configuration
The `railway.toml` file is configured for:
- Automatic builds with Nixpacks
- Health checks on the root path
- Production environment settings
- Automatic restarts on failure

## Development

### Local Development
```bash
# Install dependencies
yarn install

# Start development server
yarn dev

# Build for production
yarn build

# Preview production build
yarn preview
```

### Adding New Pages
1. Create new route files in `src/routes/`
2. Add navigation links in the appropriate layout
3. Update the sidebar navigation if needed

### Styling
- Uses Tailwind CSS for styling
- Custom components in `src/lib/components/ui/`
- Responsive design with mobile-first approach

## Troubleshooting

### Build Issues
- Ensure all dependencies are installed: `yarn install`
- Check for TypeScript errors: `yarn check`
- Verify SvelteKit configuration

### Deployment Issues
- Check Railway logs: `railway logs`
- Verify environment variables are set
- Ensure the build completes successfully

### Performance Issues
- Optimize images and assets
- Enable compression in Railway settings
- Monitor bundle size with `yarn build --analyze`

## Monitoring

### Railway Dashboard
- Monitor deployment status
- View logs and errors
- Check resource usage
- Set up alerts

### Health Checks
- Endpoint: `/`
- Expected response: 200 OK
- Timeout: 300 seconds

## Security

### Best Practices
- All sensitive data is client-side only (no server-side secrets)
- HTTPS enforced by Railway
- No API keys exposed in frontend code
- Input validation on all forms

### Data Privacy
- Sensitive data can be hidden/shown in dashboard
- No persistent storage of sensitive information
- All API calls go through secure backend

## Support

For issues with:
- **Frontend functionality**: Check browser console and network tab
- **Deployment**: Check Railway logs and build output
- **Performance**: Monitor Railway metrics and optimize accordingly

## Next Steps

1. **Connect to Backend**: Update API endpoints to point to your deployed backend
2. **Add Authentication**: Implement user login/signup flows
3. **Real-time Updates**: Add WebSocket connections for live data
4. **Analytics**: Integrate analytics tracking
5. **Testing**: Add comprehensive test suite
